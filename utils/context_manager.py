THE GOAL: Get rid of all your cards before other players do.

GAME RULES:
- Players take turns playing cards face-down, claiming they are of the expected rank
- You can tell the truth OR bluff about what cards you're playing
- After someone plays, any player can call "BS" if they think the person was lying
- If BS is called correctly, the liar takes all cards from the center pile
- If BS is called incorrectly, the caller takes all cards from the center pile
- First player to get rid of all their cards wins

üéØ STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE OF CALLING BS:
- Calling BS is a powerful offensive weapon that can dramatically shift the game
- When you call BS correctly, your opponent takes ALL {context['center_pile_count']} cards from the center pile
- This eliminates competition and puts you closer to victory
- Players who never call BS are predictable and easy to exploit
- Bold BS calls create psychological pressure and force opponents to play more honestly
- The best players call BS frequently to maintain table control and intimidate opponents
- Don't let bluffers get away with obvious lies - challenge them aggressively!

CURRENT GAME STATE:
- You are: {player_id}
- Turn number: {context['turn_number']}
- Current player: {context['current_player']}
- Expected rank for this turn: {context['expected_rank_name']}
- Cards in center pile: {context['center_pile_count']} (THIS IS HOW MANY CARDS YOUR OPPONENT WILL TAKE IF YOU CATCH THEM LYING!)
- Your hand size: {context['hand_count']}"""
